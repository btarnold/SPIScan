This SPIScan repository is originally a fork of [https://github.com/DspaceSPI/SPIScan].

However, this repo is an extension of that project that is meant to add usability and an extension of functionality to that project. This project [https://github.com/btarnold/SPIScan] is a Cal Poly Computer Engineering Capstone project during the Fall 2015 and Winter 2016 terms.

The members of the Capstone group Sea Floor Sensing that are participating in this project are:
	- Brandon Arnold
	- Mana Kulkarni
	- Aaron Newberg
	- Jon Sleep

The user of this code will be able to interact with the SPI-scanner hardware through an easy-to-use webpage controller.

TODO (on a project level):
	- Create a linux image with all necessary source files and packages installed
	- Create some instructional reference for anyone wanting to incorporate this code into their own project, including - but not limit to - the following:
		- Installed packages
		- Modified configuration files
		- Instructions for installing Linux image onto SD card
		- Recommendations (ie. large SD card w/ fast write speeds)
		- Block diagrams/Functional decomposition
		- FMEA information

Web server related:
	- To add this code to your development environment, place the files in the system directory into your web server's cgi-bin directory and put the files in the documentRoot folder into the web server's document root.

Some of the code that was forked from Dspace/SPIScan is deprecated and not used within the scope of our Capstone project (ie. some aspects of the Pyramids mockup).
