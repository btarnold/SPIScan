This SPIScan repository is originally a fork of [https://github.com/DspaceSPI/SPIScan].

However, this repo is an extension of that project that is meant to add usability and an extension of functionality to that project. This project [https://github.com/btarnold/SPIScan] is a Cal Poly Computer Engineering Capstone project during the Fall 2015 and Winter 2016 terms.

The members of the Capstone group Sea Floor Sensing that are participating in this project are:
	- Brandon Arnold
	- Mana Kulkarni
	- Aaron Newberg
	- Jon Sleep

The user of this code will be able to interact with the SPI-scanner hardware through an easy-to-use webpage controller.

To add this code to your development environment, place the files in the system directory into your web server's cgi-bin directory and put the files in the documentRoot folder into the web server's document root.

Some of the code that was forked from Dspace/SPIScan is deprecated and not used within the scope of our Capstone project (ie. some aspects of the Pyramids mockup).
